Hello, everyone! I’m new to the Balatro Modding community and still figuring out how to create a fun yet balanced structure for this mod. Currently, I’ve implemented an intriguing Pepper Joker system that I think many of you will enjoy. Please note that the code isn’t perfect at the moment, and it might cause crashes. If you encounter any issues, don’t hesitate to reach out to me here so I can address them in future updates. Thank you!

I'm excited to share that my next update will feature the delightful Sweets Jokers, packed with all sorts of whimsical and fun elements! Alongside these charming jokers, I'm introducing a brand-new Booster Pack called the Snack Pack that promises to add even more excitement to the game. You’ll also be able to combine different Jokers to create upgraded versions, enhancing your gameplay experience! 

If you’re curious, I invite you to dive in and test what I have ready so far. Be sure to follow the fandom for live updates and sneak peeks into what’s coming next! Additionally, if you’re an artist interested in collaborating on creating Jokers, Booster Packs, Consumable Cards, and more, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I would be thrilled to have your creative input in this area. Thank you all for your support, and I hope you enjoy this upcoming adventure! :)
